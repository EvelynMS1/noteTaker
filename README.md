# NoteTaker

## Description

The motivation in building this app was to connect both my knowledge of front end and backend especially understanding how servers handle requests made by users. Understanding the bigger picture of how servers and backend connect and function together. I built this project to handle user requests and respond with certain middleware functions for routes specified such as get, post and delete. This app is a simple note taker app that allows the user to add new notes, view past notes and delete notes having this all convinently stored for the user to interact with.I learned how the backend mainly interacts with the database which stores the data in JSON format, which is used to respond to the users request, approprietly. I learned about middlewares and their crucial part in completing the response for the user as well as its structure of use and the sequence in which they are processed.
